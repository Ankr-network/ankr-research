                    <p>Cloud Computing is projected to be a trillion dollar market, yet it is monopolized by some of the largest tech conglomerates in the world. Only these giants can afford the high human capital cost and upfront server costs, but this only results in a higher margin for customers.</p>
                    <p>We believe we can provide lower the barrier for businesses and consumers around the world to enter the cloud by bring compute resources closer to them at a cheaper price.</p>
