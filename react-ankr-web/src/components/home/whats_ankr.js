                  Ankr is a distributed computing platform that aims to leverage
                   idle computing resources in data centers and edge devices.What 
                   Ankr enables is a Sharing Economy model where enterprises and 
                   consumers can monetize their spare computing capacities from 
                   their devices, on - premise servers, private cloud and even public
                    cloud.This enables Ankr to provide computing power much closer to 
                    users at a much cheaper price.
