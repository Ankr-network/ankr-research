# SGX C++ Code Examples

I have created two examples. One is a hello world style program, and the other is a basic stats calculator.

Note:  This project was inspired by: https://github.com/digawp/hello-enclave . See that link for further specific information.

In to run these projects make sure that the SGX SDK and driver are installed on your machine. To make and run, do the following in terminal:

1. make
2. ./app
