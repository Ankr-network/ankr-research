# Background regarding µRaiden

µRaiden is an off-chain payment channel framework, which is fast and unidirectional. µRaiden allows users to make micropayments, or pay-per-use. This is particulary helpful for our DCCN since users will pay-per-compute. An interactive example of how µRaiden works can be seen in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=140&v=QZFbHyagVCc

https://microraiden.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dev-setup.html
https://microraiden.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/blockchain.html

# Working with µRaiden 
After following the above tutorials, follow the steps listed on this link: https://github.com/raiden-network/microraiden.
There are a few examples that can be run that shows how µRaiden works. Running the demo_proxy.py and echo_client.py demostrates the basic functionality of µRaiden.
