# Ankr Network Intel SGX Docker image

Build Docker image for Intel SGX from scratch.

The current version of the image supports building and running SGX-based applications in SIM mode, but DOES NOT support HW mode yet.
This issue is due to misconfiguration of the Intel SGX PSW (platform software).
